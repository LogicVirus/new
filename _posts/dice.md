Roll the Dice by Charles Bukowski
---
If you’re going to try, go all the
way.
Otherwise, don’t even start.

If you’re going to try, go all the
way. This could mean losing girlfriends,
wives, relatives, jobs and
maybe your mind.

Go all the way.
It could mean not eating for 3 or
4 days.
It could mean freezing on a
park bench.
It could mean jail,
It could mean derision,
mockery,
isolation.
Isolation is the gift,
all the others are a test of your
endurance, of
how much you really want to
do it.
And you’ll do it
despite rejection and the
worst odds
and it will be better than
anything else
you can imagine.

If you’re going to try,
go all the way.
There is no other feeling like
that.
You will be alone with the
gods
and the nights will flame with
fire.

Do it, do it, do it.
Do it.

All the way
all the way.
You will ride life straight to
perfect laughter,
It’s the only good fight
there is​.
