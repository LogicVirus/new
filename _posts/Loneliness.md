Loneliness by Charles Bukowski



I've never been lonely,

In a room, suicidal, I've been,

Depressed, feeling awful, awful beyond all.

Never felt that one other person could enter,

Enter that room and cure what was bothering me.

Any number of people could enter that room,

But loneliness is something I've never been bothered with.


I've always had this terrible itch for solitude,

Being at a party, a stadium full of cheering people,

Is where I might feel loneliness.

Because there's nothing out there,

It's triviality, stupid people mingling with stupid people.


Never been bothered with the need to rush out into the night,

Hid in bars because I didn't want to hide in factories.

That's all.
